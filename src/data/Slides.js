/* important thing to understand about 'description' :
the <br/> tag means a new line will start and we will have
to add "*" after it, to make our design consistent.
EX:
* consectetur sint veniam, corrupti consequatur <br />* ipsa labore
    nobis eveniet,
    <br />* ipsa labore nobis eveniet,
    <br />`
